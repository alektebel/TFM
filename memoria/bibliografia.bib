  abstract = {This paper presents the design and implementation of an AI vision-controlled orthotic hand exoskeleton to enhance rehabilitation and assistive functionality for individuals with hand mobility impairments. The system leverages a Google Coral Dev Board Micro with an Edge TPU to enable real-time object detection using a customized MobileNet_V2 model trained on a six-class dataset. The exoskeleton autonomously detects objects, estimates proximity, and triggers pneumatic actuation for grasp-and-release tasks, eliminating the need for user-specific calibration needed in traditional EMG-based systems. Experimental results demonstrate a 51ms inference speed and 8-hour runtime with a 1300 mAh battery, though challenges persist in model robustness under varying lighting conditions.}
